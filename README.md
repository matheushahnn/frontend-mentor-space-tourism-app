## Overview
This is a application that I created to put in practice nextJS and tailwindcss. Both technologies are new for me and I see this Frontend Mentor challenge as a opportunity to improve my skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned
I learned how to create a projext using Nextjs, how to manage the routes and how to deploy to vercel.
Also, I learned how to use tailwindcss. I like the idea to use a lib to create styles just using pre generated classes, but I couldn't create a perfect pixel layout and I felt that is to complicated to create new classes for intermediate formattings.

### Continued development

I will focus to split better the components, there are some components that does not need to be duplicated.
Also, there are any unit test, I intent to create some unit tests even though there is no much complex code.
